//Create a simple Java program that acts like a registration form for a website. The program should ask 
//the user for their first name and age, then display a welcome message with their input. Store the input 
//code in a user-defined package called registration. Use clear comments to explain your code. Save the file 
//as WelcomeForm.java and make sure it runs correctly.
